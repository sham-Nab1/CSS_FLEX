# CSS FLEX

**Overview**

This CSS_FLEX project repository showcases how to utilize CSS flexbox in HTML documents via the "style" attribute. 
By setting an element's "display" property to "flex," it transforms into a flexible container that can be further 
styled with additional properties.

**CSS Layout Models**

Grid and Flexbox are crucial CSS layout models that help developers create responsive designs. Grid is ideal for 
managing two-dimensional layouts, allowing precise control over element placement in rows and columns. In contrast, 
Flexbox focuses on one-dimensional layouts, simplifying the alignment and distribution of items in a single direction.

**Flexible Box Layout Module**

The Flexible Box Layout Module, or Flexbox, supports responsive design without relying on floats or positioning. 
When the display property is set to flex, both the container and its child elements can adjust smoothly to 
different screen sizes.

**Important Flexbox properties include:**

flex-direction: Defines the arrangement of items, either horizontally or vertically.
flex-wrap: Indicates whether items should wrap onto new lines when there isnâ€™t enough space.
justify-content: Controls alignment along the main axis.
align-items: Manages alignment along the cross axis.
These properties streamline layout management and improve responsiveness.

**Project Structure**

The project consists of five HTML pages, each dedicated to a specific dataset: dramas, employees, products, 
movies, and students, all presented in a flexible format to illustrate the capabilities of CSS Flexbox.
